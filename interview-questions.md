# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters are generic names that are passed through a function. Arguments are the actual values that will be passed through a function

  Researched answer: Parameters are the real values passed to and received by the function



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: Value, index and array. Value is required while Index and Array are optional. Value is the current element in an array that is being iterated, index is the current element being iterated, and array is the reference array

  Researched answer: Value, index, array, and thisArg. Value is the current element being processed. Index is the current index of the current element being processed. Array is the array .map() was claled upon. thisArg is the value to use as this when executing the call back function.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring allows you to use the keys in an object as variables. Syntax: var {key1, key2} = obj. By destructuring it, you can access the value in a key by just referencing the keys key1 and key 2 instead of obj.key1 or obj.key2

  Researched answer: Destructuring assignment syntax is a JS expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Functions are blocks of code that are re-usable when called upon. A Method is a function that serves as a key in an object that can execute inside of the same object.

  Researched answer: Functions are a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. Methods are functions that are a property of an object.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:A Class is a blueprint of an object that contains blocks of code that is re-usable and customizeable. An Object is a collection of key:value pairs

  Researched answer: Classes are templates for creating objects. Objects are unique entities which contain property and methods.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting allows you to call on a function before it is defined.

  Researched answer: Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of the scope, prior to execution of the code



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:

2. React:A JS library for building user interfaces

3. React state: React has a built-in state object. State object is where you store porperty values that belong to that component

4. React lifecycle methods: Iinitialization, the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. Mounting, the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself. Updating, is the when the state of the component is updates and application is repainted. Unmounting, the final tep of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page

5. DOM: Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
